# BasketSim-Java-Game
A text-based basketball simulation game created as senior project at UMUC. 

This game was built in netbeans. Any suitable IDE can open and run the current build.

Upon running, a window will open up and you must first read a file to create players and teams. 
The data.txt file has been used in testing, but the user can select any file with the proper 
formatted data. New players and teams can be created and then matched up to simulate a game.
